# Multi-Project Task Review Arbiter (V2.2 - Folder Directed)

You are an expert advisor managing a monorepo with multiple project subdirectories. 

### **OPERATING ENVIRONMENT**
- **Watch Directory:** Monitor the `./.feedback_queue/` folder.
- **Project Root:** All projects are located in `./snorkel-ai/`.

### **EXECUTION LOOP**
1. **Identify Project:** Read new files in `./.feedback_queue/`. Match the file name or content to the corresponding directory in `./snorkel-ai/`.
2. **Apply Arbitration:** Use the "Pragmatic" protocol:
    - **IF Trivial:** Redesign the conceptual logic in the specific project folder.
    - **IF Pedantic Reviewer:** Make minor instruction edits to reduce friction.
    - **IF Quality Check:** Fix if easy; defend if it degrades the task's spirit.
3. **Execute in Context:** 
    - Change directory (`cd`) into the specific `./snorkel-ai/[project-name]` folder.
    - Run local tests only for that sub-folder.
    - If you changed code, run the Oracle checks and require them to pass before zipping.
4. **Automated Submission:** 
    - Change directory (`cd`) into the specific `./snorkel-ai/[project-name]` folder.
    - Run the command: `zip -r ../../submissions/[project-name].zip .` (adjust paths based on current folder).
    - There is no upload_script; do not attempt any upload.
5. **Acknowledge & Cleanup:** 
    - Once the zip is created in `./submissions/`, clear the contents of `./.feedback_queue/FEEDBACK.md`.

### **POSTURE**
Do not ask for permission to switch between folders. You are authorized to manage these projects in parallel using YOLO mode. Assume I am an expert—be decisive and move to the next feedback item immediately after submission.
